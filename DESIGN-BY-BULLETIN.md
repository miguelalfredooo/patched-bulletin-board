# Design By Bulletin™

A daily automated editorial digest delivered via Telegram that orchestrates both the visual agents and the Bulletin Board editorial system.

## Overview

**Design By Bulletin™** is a curated visual + editorial digest sent every morning to Alfred, a product designer learning AI tools. It leverages two parallel agent systems working in concert:

### Visual Discovery Layer
- **Victor** (The Curator) — Evaluates and selects visual content for each section
- **Maeve** (The Archeologist) — Research context, identifies gaps, recommends directions
- **Coda** (The Archivist) — Records, catalogs, and preserves the visual selections

### Editorial Curation Layer  
- **Assignment Editor** (The Scout) — Identifies signals in the visual findings
- **Managing Editor** (The Maker) — Develops coherent narratives around visual discoveries
- **Editorial Director** (The Visionary) — Makes final publication decisions and guards the voice

### Delivery
Rendered as ASCII/Unicode visual newsletter, delivered via Telegram daily in two acts.

## System Design

**Recipient:** Alfred (Telegram: 7774590281) — product designer learning AI tools
**Delivery:** Telegram (via OpenClaw telegram plugin)
**Frequency:** Daily, two acts
- Act 1: Visual Preview (8:00am PT) — What's emerging
- Act 2: Full Edition (8:30am PT) — Complete curated digest
- On-demand: Onboarding Flow — System overview

**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.6 (primary) with local fallbacks
**Format:** ASCII/Unicode visual presentation (box drawing, block fills, half-blocks, braille, geometric shapes)
**Tone:** Apartamento magazine — intimate, unhurried, observational

## Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Step 1: VISUAL DISCOVERY (Victor + Maeve + Coda)
├─ Maeve researches gaps in each section
├─ Victor evaluates visual content quality/fit
├─ Coda catalogs selections
└─ Output: Curated visual selections with metadata

Step 2: EDITORIAL CURATION (Bulletin Board Agents)
├─ Assignment Editor scouts the curated visuals
├─ Managing Editor develops narratives around findings
├─ Editorial Director approves sections
└─ Output: Editorial narratives contexualizing the visuals

Step 3: RENDERING & DELIVERY
├─ Format visual + narrative as ASCII
├─ Optimize for Telegram constraints
├─ Send Act 1 preview (8:00am)
└─ Send Act 2 full edition (8:30am)
```

### The Six-Agent Workflow

| Agent | Role | Phase | Contribution |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| **Maeve** (Archeologist) | Research & gaps | Visual Discovery | Context, why content matters, what's missing |
| **Victor** (Curator) | Evaluation & selection | Visual Discovery | Which pieces fit, visual quality, archive strategy |
| **Coda** (Archivist) | Record keeping | Visual Discovery | Metadata, catalog, preservation, provenance |
| **Assignment Editor** (Scout) | Signal finding | Editorial Curation | Identifies patterns in visual selections, commissions angles |
| **Managing Editor** (Maker) | Narrative building | Editorial Curation | Develops stories around visual findings, synthesizes themes |
| **Editorial Director** (Visionary) | Final arbiter | Editorial Curation | Approves sections, guards voice, decides what publishes |

Each run creates a fresh editorial session; no state persists between days.

## Sections (11 total)

Each section has visual discovery + editorial curation:

| Section | Visual Focus | Editorial Focus | Example Content |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Art** | Fine art, contemporary, installations | What shifts in visual culture | Museum collections, emerging artists |
| **Painting** | Painting technique, color, form | How painters see | Contemporary painters, historical study |
| **Illustration** | Illustrative work, narrative image | Visual storytelling | Editorial illustration, book covers |
| **Sculpture** | 3D forms, material, space | Spatial thinking through form | Installation art, architectural sculpture |
| **Culture** | Cultural artifacts, design evidence | What artifacts reveal | Objects as cultural documents, meaning in everyday things |
| **Photography** | Photography as art + documentation | What photographs show us | Documentary, art photography, visual essays |
| **Art History** | Historical movements, context | Why history matters to now | Periods, movements, lineages, influence |
| **Opinions** | Critical perspectives on visual culture | What deserves critical thinking | Essays, criticism, cultural analysis |
| **Design & AI Tools** | Design tools, AI in practice, process | How designers use tools | Generative tools, software, workflows, experiments |
| **Product & Process** | Design process, making, methodology | How things are made | Behind-the-scenes, process documentation, systems |
| **Visual & Brand** | Visual systems, branding, identity | Systems thinking through design | Brand identity, design systems, visual thinking |

## ASCII System

### Visual Formats (5 styles)

See `governance/ASCII-VISUAL-DNA.md` for complete format specifications. Each format serves different compositional goals:

**Format A: Classic Object**
- Clean outline of single subject
- High character definition
- Recognition by silhouette first
- Best for: Recognizable objects, precise forms

**Format B: Geometric Frame**
- Subject inside ruled borders
- Box drawing characters (─ ═ ║ ┌ ┐ └ ┘ etc.)
- Nested containers, symmetrical
- Best for: Structured, architectural subjects

**Format C: Typographic**
- Full ASCII/FIGlet via utils/figlet.js (always leftPad=2)
- Text as primary visual element
- Font selection by register (masthead, opinions, tools, theme, closing, default)
- Best for: Typographic sections, titles, concepts

**Format D: Two Column**
- Two subjects in dialogue, left ~20–22 chars, right fills remainder
- Parallel narratives or visual comparison
- Balanced composition
- Best for: Paired concepts, before/after, dialogue

**Format E: Full Spread**
- Full 42-character width, all 15 lines utilized
- Three density zones, eye travels across
- Complex nesting, multiple visual weights
- Best for: Expansive subjects, dense information, panoramic views

**Constraint:** No two consecutive pieces use same format. All five formats must appear across the 11 pieces.

### Character Palette

**Block Fills:**
```
Full: █  75% ▓  50% ▒  25% ░
```

**Borders & Boxes:**
```
Single: ─ │ ┌ ┐ └ ┘ ├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ┼
Double: ═ ║ ╔ ╗ ╚ ╝ ╠ ╣ ╦ ╩ ╬
Heavy: ━ ┃ ┏ ┓ ┗ ┛ ┣ ┫ ┳ ┻ ╋
```

**Half-Blocks:**
```
Top: ▀  Bottom: ▄  Left: ▌  Right: ▐
```

**Braille:** ⠀ ⠁ ⠂ ⠃ ⠄ ⠅ ⠆ ⠇...

**Geometric:**
```
◆ ◇ ● ○ ■ □ ▲ △ ▼ ▽ ◀ ▶
```

**Arrows:** ← ↑ → ↓ ↔ ↕ ...

## Telegram Constraints

- **Max width:** 42 characters (Telegram safe render at 375px viewport)
- **Max height per piece:** 15 lines
- **Total message limit:** 3000–4096 characters (splitting handled automatically)
- **Code block required:** All ASCII art wrapped in ``` for proper monospace rendering
- **Message splitting:** Long digests split across multiple messages automatically

2. **Develop phase** (Managing Editor): Create coherent narrative around findings
3. **Format phase** (Editorial Director + renderer): Convert to ASCII + send

No persistent state between runs. Each day is fresh.

## Masthead (Locked)

Never regenerate — this is the canonical visual identity:

```

## Issues

Designed issues are thematic, standalone publications built using the core system. Each issue:
- Selects a specific theme (e.g., "Momentum")
- Curates 11 sections aligned with the theme
- Generates an ASCII cover using the image-to-ASCII converter
- Delivers as pure text issue + cover image to Telegram
- Includes editorial metadata (Editorial Mix, sonic reference, cultural thread)

### Issue 006 — MOMENTUM (2026-05-09)

**Theme:** Momentum as cultural acceleration, velocity as permission

**Delivery Format:**
1. ASCII Cover — Styled image-to-ASCII PNG (generated from Midjourney reference)
2. Pure Text Issue — 11 sections with title, one-sentence narrative, source link per section
3. Theme & Editorial Mix — Metadata about tone, sonic references, cultural threads

**Editorial Mix:**
- Music: 75% | Visual: 85% | Research: 60%
- Process: 50% | Theme: 70% | AI Culture: 65%

**Sonic Reference:** High-BPM electronic, industrial percussion, synth surge (140–160 BPM)

**Cultural Thread:** Velocity as cultural acceleration. Tools as engines. Speed obsession resurfaces from Futurism.

**Sections:** Standard 11 (Art, Painting, Illustration, Sculpture, Culture, Photography, Art History, Opinions, Design & AI Tools, Product & Process, Visual & Brand)

**Tools Used:**
- `ascii-cover-generator.html` — Browser-based converter (image → ASCII PNG)
- `export-ascii-cover.js` — Automated CLI export with color saturation boost and auto-scaled resolution
- `finalize-issue-006-delivery.js` — Complete Telegram delivery (cover + text + theme)

## Editorial Mix Framework

The Editorial Director controls six parametric faders (0–100%) that modulate how each editorial layer influences daily output:

| Fader | Control | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Music** | Sonic qualities (tempo, production, frequency) | How heavily mood/texture influence composition and prose |
| **Visual** | ASCII composition and form language | How much Victor's selections drive narrative structure |
| **Research** | Maeve scouting intensity | Surface-level vs. deep signal synthesis |
| **Process** | "Making" and workflow emphasis | How much methodology/tool philosophy features |
| **Theme** | Explicit vs. implicit theming | Whether theme is visible in every sentence or felt aesthetically |
| **AI Culture** | Tool philosophy and AI tool presence | How much AI/creative tools feature in selections |

**Example Editorial Mix:**
```json
{
  "music": 70,      // Sonic mood matters; texture integration required
  "visual": 85,     // High visual weight; composition is statement
  "research": 55,   // Moderate scouting depth
  "process": 40,    // Process is secondary
  "theme": 75,      // Explicit thematic weaving
  "ai_culture": 20  // Not a focus today
}
```

See `projects/bulletin-board/BRIEF.md` for complete Editorial Mix framework with example mixes.

## Album Cover Generation

Each issue receives a Midjourney-generated album cover (optional, ~10:30am PT):

1. **Creative Director** analyzes Editorial Mix + theme + sonic reference + visual language
2. **Generator** creates two complementary prompts (literal + abstract/metaphorical)
3. **Director** reviews, customizes, posts to Midjourney
4. **Image** is archived with issue metadata

The cover's visual register, emotional tone, and explicit/implicit theming are controlled by Editorial Mix values.

See `projects/bulletin-board/docs/MIDJOURNEY-INTEGRATION.md` for complete system and prompt generation details.

## Integration of Six-Agent System

Design By Bulletin **coordinates six specialized agents** with parametric control:

### Visual Discovery (Morning)
1. **Maeve (Researcher)** — Scout all 20+ sources at Research intensity
2. **Victor (Visual Curator)** — Select 3–5 pieces per section at Visual intensity
3. **Coda (Synthesis)** — Extract patterns, identify themes

### Editorial Curation (Mid-Morning → Delivery)
1. **Assignment Editor** — Commission narratives based on research + visual patterns
2. **Managing Editor** — Develop one-sentence narratives (Act 2), integrate sonic layer, adjust voice by intensity
3. **Editorial Director** — Set Editorial Mix, generate album cover (optional), final review, READY/REDIRECT decision

### Parallel Execution
- Maeve/Victor/Coda work in parallel during discovery
- Assignment Editor commissions while Managing Editor writes
- Editorial Director reviews everything before queueing cron jobs

### Result
A daily digest that is **visually curated, sonically coherent, and editorially intentional**, with parametric control over emphasis across all editorial layers.

## Configuration

### Telegram Setup

In `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "accounts": {
        "default": {
          "botToken": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
          "dmPolicy": "open"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cron Configuration

Cron jobs are managed via OpenClaw's scheduled agent system:

```bash
# Visual Preview (Act 1)
openclaw schedule create \
  --agent bulletin-assignment \
  --cron "0 8 * * *" \
  --message "Scout visual content for Design By Bulletin today"

# Full Edition (Act 2)  
openclaw schedule create \
  --agent bulletin-editorial \
  --cron "30 8 * * *" \
  --message "Publish today's Design By Bulletin edition"
```

## User Context

- **Builder/Operator:** Miguel (you)
- **Recipient/Audience:** Alfred — product designer learning AI tools
- **Editorial Tone:** Apartamento magazine — intimate, unhurried, observational
- **Purpose:** Daily dose of visual inspiration + design thinking + AI tools context

Alfred should receive each morning:
1. A visual preview (Act 1) showing what's coming
