### Usage Rules

1. **Always include the hero cover** at the start of ACT 1
2. **Comes before all section ASCII art** (sections 1-11)
3. **Must be inside code block** when sent to Telegram (for monospace rendering)
4. **Logo and dividers are identical** across all issues — never change them
5. **Only update:** Issue number, theme name, and publication date

### Example Variations

**Issue 001 — Presence (May 5, 2026):**

```

### Font Requirements

- **Font:** Monospace (Courier, Courier New, or equivalent)
- **Size:** Standard terminal/code block size
- **Rendering:** Telegram code blocks preserve alignment automatically
- **Width:** ~38 characters (optimized for Telegram mobile + desktop)

### Bot Delivery

**In `/preview` command:** Hero cover is first thing in code block
**In `/digest` command:** Hero cover is first thing in code block
**Standalone mode:** Hero cover can be sent alone as a complete message in code block
**Wrapping:** Always inside triple backticks (```)

### Standalone Usage

The hero cover is completely self-contained and requires no additional context. It can be used independently as:
- A standalone announcement of a new issue
- A cover/intro card separate from the full editorial content
- A visual marker in any context needing issue identification

**Example standalone delivery:**
```
██████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ™
██╔══██╗██╔══██╗██╔══██╗
██║  ██║██████╔╝██████╔╝
██║  ██║██╔══██╗██╔══██╗
██████╔╝██████╔╝██████╔╝
╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝

Design By Bulletin™
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Issue 006
Momentum • May 9, 2026
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

This can be sent as a complete message with no prose or additional sections.

### Current Implementation

- ✅ All 10 issues (001-010) use standardized hero template
- ✅ Consistent branding across all deliveries
- ✅ Logo and dividers never change
- ✅ Only metadata (issue #, theme, date) updates per issue

### File Locations

Hero template appears in each issue file:

## Component 3: Editorial Grid

Editorial prose sections forming the intellectual backbone of each issue (ACT 2). Each of the 11 sections pairs with its corresponding ASCII art piece from ACT 1, providing critical context, cultural references, and source attribution.

### Overview

The Editorial Grid consists of 11 prose sections, one for each visual section:

1. **Art** — Visual foundation & artistic practice
2. **Painting** — Color, form, and pigment
3. **Illustration** — Line, composition, and drawing
4. **Sculpture** — Space, material, and dimensionality
5. **Culture** — Social context and cultural significance
6. **Photography** — Light, frame, and documentation
7. **Art History** — Lineage, tradition, and historical perspective
8. **Opinions** — Critical perspective and philosophical angles
9. **Design & AI Tools** — Digital practice and systems
10. **Product & Process** — Making, craft, and methodology
11. **Visual & Brand** — Identity, mark, and visual systems

### Structure & Format

**Naming & Placement:** Appears in ACT 2 of issue files, immediately following the complete ACT 1

**Section Format:**
```
**[Section Name] — [Thematic Subtitle]**
[2-4 sentences of contextual prose, artist/maker references, and thematic development]
*[Source: Publication/Outlet Name]*
```

**Components:**
- **Section Header** — Bold section name + em dash + thematic subtitle that relates to issue theme
- **Body Text** — Prose (typically 2-4 sentences) that connects visual theme to cultural/critical context
- **Source Attribution** — Italicized source reference pointing to publication, artist, or reference material

### Specifications

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Sections per issue** | 11 (one per editorial topic) |
| **Body length** | 2-4 sentences (~60-120 words per section) |
| **Prose style** | Narrative, critical, contextual |
| **References** | Artists, makers, designers, cultural figures, academic concepts |
| **Source format** | `*[Source: Publisher/Platform]*` |
| **Consistency** | Thematic coherence with issue theme; balanced across all 11 perspectives |

### Example Editorial Section

**From Issue 010 — Worn:**

```
**Art — Sherald's Raw Linen**
Paintings that age on the canvas. Sherald's practice treats material and time as collaborators. The painting wears in rather than deteriorates.
*[Source: Artsy]*
```

### Usage in Issues

**Location:** Appears as part of ACT 2, after all visual content
**Format:** Plain text prose (no code blocks for these sections)
**Context:** Each section mirrors its corresponding ASCII art piece from ACT 1, providing intellectual depth

**Example placement:**
```
## ACT 2 — FULL EDITION

**Art — Sherald's Raw Linen**
Paintings that age on the canvas...
*[Source: Artsy]*

**Painting — Dissolution Through Use**
Cecily Brown's figures dissolving...
*[Source: Booooooom]*

[... continues for all 11 sections ...]
```

### Content Characteristics

**Thematic Alignment:** Each issue's Editorial Grid responds to and amplifies the central theme

**Issue 010 (Worn) examples:**
- Art addresses patina and temporal markers
- Culture discusses Japanese pottery tradition (wabi-sabi)
- Photography explores meaning accumulation through repeated viewing
- Design & AI Tools covers systems maturing through use

**Issue 009 (Material) examples:**
- Art focuses on materiality as medium (body, flesh, organic matter)
- Painting emphasizes pigment as substance
- Illustration highlights paper as protagonist
- Photography celebrates film stock and grain as aesthetic choice

**Voice and References:** Combines artist/maker names, cultural theory, design practice, and contemporary references. Sources range from specialized publications (Artsy, Frieze, Magnum Photos) to broader cultural platforms (The New Yorker, Wired, Brand New).

### Standalone Usage

Editorial sections can be extracted and used independently:
- Individual section can be shared as a critical perspective on a topic
- Multiple sections on a single theme across different issues form a thematic collection
- Sources enable follow-up research and deeper exploration

**Standalone example:**
```
**Photography — Fukase's Ravens**
Bird photography about sky worn by presence. Light changing through repeated viewings and use of the negative. The image accumulates meaning.
*[Source: LensCulture]*
```

## Component 4: Closing Sentence

The thematic cornerstone of each issue—a single poetic statement that captures the essence of the theme and leaves a lasting impression on readers.

### Structure

**Format:** Single line, in quotation marks, italicized or plain text

**Placement:** Immediately follows the 11-section Editorial Grid, between last source attribution and the Metadata Footer

```
**CLOSING SENTENCE:**
"The things worth keeping are the things that show you used them."
```

### Characteristics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Length** | 8-15 words (concise, memorable) |
| **Voice** | Poetic, distilled, universal |
| **Scope** | Encapsulates the entire issue's theme |
| **Tone** | Reflective, often philosophical or paradoxical |
| **Style** | Aphoristic—can stand alone as wisdom |

### Examples Across Issues

**Issue 001 (Presence):**
"Your presence changes the room."

**Issue 007 (Interval):**
"The space between is where meaning lives."

**Issue 008 (Threshold):**
"Every threshold is a place where you are still both things at once."

**Issue 009 (Material):**
"Everything digital is downstream of something you can hold."

**Issue 010 (Worn):**
"The things worth keeping are the things that show you used them."

### Standalone Usage

The Closing Sentence is completely self-contained and can function independently:

- Featured in promotional materials for the issue
- Quoted in cross-platform marketing without additional context

**Example standalone delivery:**
```
"The space between is where meaning lives."

— Design By Bulletin™ Issue 007
```

### Thematic Function

The Closing Sentence distills 11 perspectives (Art, Painting, Illustration, etc.) into a single truth. It's the moment where all editorial voices converge into one unified statement.

**Relationship to Editorial Grid:**
- The Editorial Grid explores a theme across disciplines
